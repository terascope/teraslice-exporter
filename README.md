# Teraslice Job Exporter README

NOTE: This exporter is EOL and no longer maintained.  As of the completion of
https://github.com/terascope/teraslice/issues/3600 in Teraslice, an exporter is
built into the Teraslice master.  Search the
[Teraslice Documentation](https://terascope.github.io/teraslice/docs/configuration/overview/#terafoundation-configuration-reference)
for `prom_metrics_enabled`.

Note: This exporter is only meant for use with Teraslice using Kubernetes
clustering.  It hasn't been tested with Teraslice running in Native clustering
mode.

## Usage

So far it works like this:

```bash
TERASLICE_URL="https://localhost" \
  TERASLICE_DISPLAY_URL="https://teraslice-xyz.lan" \
  DEBUG=True \
  NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/path/to/ca.crt \
  node dist/index.js | bunyan
```

All options are passed as environment variables

```bash
TERASLICE_URL="https://localhost" \
  TERASLICE_DISPLAY_URL="https://teraslice-xyz.lan" \
  DEBUG=True \
  NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/path/to/ca.crt \
  PORT=4242 \
  TERASLICE_QUERY_DELAY=90000 \
  node dist/index.js | bunyan
```

The `TERASLICE_URL` is the only environment variable that is required.

### Environment variables

* `TERASLICE_URL` - URL to the Teraslice Instance to Monitor
* `TERASLICE_DISPLAY_URL` - Optional override of TERASLICE_URL for metric label purposes only
* `DEBUG` - Enable debug logging
* `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` - Standard Node variable to specify CA cert for SSL
connections
* `PORT` - The port that the http express server will listen on
* `TERASLICE_QUERY_DELAY` - The delay between updating the Teraslice stats, this
value is in ms.

### Docker

Build the docker image:

```bash
docker build -t teraslice-exporter:v0.4.0 .
```

Run the docker image:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 \
    -e TERASLICE_URL="http://url.to.teraslice/" \
    teraslice-exporter:v0.4.0 | bunyan
```

## Design

The exporter will scrape several of the Teraslice API endpoints every
`TERASLICE_QUERY_DELAY` milliseconds and update it's exported metrics after that
update is completed.
